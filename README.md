# VrKnowledgeBase
QuickWin Award for Children's Health


Inspiration
In designing this knowledge base, we took a lot of inspiration from online textbooks organized in trees, such as Mindtap by Cengage. This organization allowed students like me to easily find and access specific chapters and sections, as opposed to sifting through seas of text to find my relevant sections.

What it does
A centralized knowledge base meant to train employees unfamiliar with the VR systems used within Children's Health Medical Center. Documents are divided in folders for IT employees and end users.

How we built it
We first imported all of the files into the knowledge base, and then reformatted them to reflect the original formatting in the word documents. Then, we sifted through the documents to determine if it was meant for IT employees or end users, and sorted them as such.

Challenges we ran into
At first, we were unsure which platform would be the best, so we experimented with multiple platforms. In addition, we had to reformat some of the documents and sort them into the proper category.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Decluttering a folders of files in a way that allows for easy access to specific information.

What we learned
We learned that the way information is presented can greatly affect audience engagement and retention levels, and that knowledge bases can efficiently organize large amounts of information.

What's next for VR Knowledge Base
Many potential developments and modifications are possible. We can use AI models to summarize technical documents for non-technical people. Also, we could utilize a template or create a custom template to better cater specifically to the user audience. Furthermore, the knowledgebase could be transferred onto its own domain for further customization.
